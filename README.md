# bt3-dp-editor
A resident file editor that reads/writes the DP amounts for every character in Budokai Tenkaichi 3.

# Usage
Yup, yet another command-line tool, except it takes just two arguments:
* ``-r``, which reads the DP amounts from the given resident files in the ``in`` folder;
* ``-w``, which overwrites the DP amounts with ones given in a CSV file named ``dp-list.csv``.

The CSV I provided has the values I used for DBZ Sparking! HYPER.
